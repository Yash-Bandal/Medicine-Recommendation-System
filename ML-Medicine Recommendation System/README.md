```python
models = {
    'SVC': SVC(kernel='linear'),
    'RandomForest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
    'GradientBoosting': GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
    'KNeighbors': KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5),
    'MultinomialNB': MultinomialNB()
}

def helper(dis):
    desc = description[description['Disease'] == dis]['Description']
    desc = " ".join([w for w in desc])

    pre = precautions[precautions['Disease'] == dis][['Precaution_1', 'Precaution_2', 'Precaution_3', 'Precaution_4']]
    pre = [col for col in pre.values]

    med = medications[medications['Disease'] == dis]['Medication']
    med = [med for med in med.values]

    die = diets[diets['Disease'] == dis]['Diet']
    die = [die for die in die.values]

    wrkout = workout[workout['disease'] == dis]['workout']

    return desc, pre, med, die, wrkout
```
